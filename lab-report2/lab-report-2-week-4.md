# Lab Report 2
**This lab will help you with the debugging.**

## 1. Error 1
You can download the test file [here](https://github.com/Meng-zmy/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/1557d6dd6053e678865c2efaba30832bdc7d7d9c/lab-report2/test-file1.md)

**Symptom:** By using this test file, the result I get is incorrect. We want to have only the address of the link, but it also print out the address of the image. Since the image format is `![]()`, it also contain `[]()`.
