* Installing VScode

    We can download the *VScode* from the [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can choose the correct version for your computer. For example, my computer is a Mac, then I choose the version for macOS. 

	When you open the VScode, it should look like the picture below.

* Remotely Connecting

    We need to open the terminal in VScode, then command `ssh cs15lsp22(the letters in your course-specific account)@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. The first time you log in will ask your “Are you sure you want to continue connecting”, you should choose yes. Then you need to put in your password. If you are successfully logged in, your terminal will look like the following picture.
